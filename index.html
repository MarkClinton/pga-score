            <p>Welcome to the PGA Score.</p>
            <p>PGA Score is a card based memory game designed to test both
                your memory and knowledge of golf. The idea is simple,
                depending on your choice of course (difficulty) a number of
                cards will display, face down, in the game area.
            </p>
            <p>Each card will have a corresponding match, match all pairs to win
                the game.
            </p>
